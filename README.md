# [The **run-vcpkg** action for caching artifacts and using vcpkg on GitHub](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-vcpkg)

The **run-vcpkg** action restores from cache [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) along with the previously installed ports. Briefly:
 - If there is a cache miss, vpckg is fetched and installed; the cache's key is composed by hashing the hosting OS name, the command line arguments and the vcpkg's commit id.
 - Then `vcpkg` is run to install the desired ports. This is a no-op if artifacts are already restored; this step can be skipped with `setupOnly:true`;
 - Artifacts and vcpkg are finally cached (if needed) with a post action at the end of the `job`.

The provided [samples](#samples) use [GitHub hosted runners](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners).

Good companions are the [run-cmake](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-cmake) action and the 
[get-cmake](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/get-cmake) actions.

### <a id='install'>Setup vcpkg and install ports</a>

It is __highly recommended__ to [use vcpkg as a submodule](#best-practices). Here below the sample where vcpkg is a Git submodule:

```yaml
  # Sample when vcpkg is a submodule of your repository (highly recommended!)

    #-uses: actions/cache@v1   <===== YOU DO NOT NEED THIS!

    # Install latest CMake.
    - uses: lukka/get-cmake@latest

    # Restore from cache the previously built ports. If "cache miss", then provision vcpkg, install desired ports, finally cache everything for the next run.
    - name: Restore from cache and run vcpkg
      uses: lukka/run-vcpkg@v2
      with:
        # Response file stored in source control, it provides the list of ports and triplet(s).
        vcpkgArguments: '@${{ env.vcpkgResponseFile }}'
        # Location of the vcpkg as submodule of the repository.
        vcpkgDirectory: '${{ github.workspace }}/vcpkg'
        # Since the cache must be invalidated when content of the response file changes, let's
        # compute its hash and append this to the computed cache's key.
        appendedCacheKey: ${{ hashFiles(env.vcpkgResponseFile) }}

    - name: 'Build with CMake and Ninja'
      uses: lukka/run-cmake@v2
      with:
        cmakeListsOrSettingsJson: CMakeListsTxtAdvanced
        cmakeListsTxtPath: '${{ github.workspace }}/cmakesettings.json/CMakeLists.txt'
        useVcpkgToolchainFile: true
        buildDirectory: '${{ runner.workspace }}/b/ninja'
        cmakeAppendedArgs: '-GNinja Multi-Config'
        # Or build multiple configurations out of a CMakeSettings.json file created with Visual Studio.
        # cmakeListsOrSettingsJson: CMakeSettingsJson
        # cmakeSettingsJsonPath: '${{ github.workspace }}/cmakesettings.json/CMakeSettings.json'
        # configurationRegexFilter: '${{ matrix.configuration }}'
```

### <a id='setuponly'>Setup vcpkg only</a>

When `setupOnly: true`, it only setups vcpkg and set VCPKG_ROOT environment variable without installing any port. The provisioned vcpkg can then be used as follows in a subsequent step:

```yaml
    # Restore from cache the previously built ports. If cache-miss, download, build vcpkg.
    - name: Restore from cache and install vcpkg
      # Download and build vcpkg, without installing any port. If content is cached already, it is a no-op.
      uses: lukka/run-vcpkg@v2
      with:
        setupOnly: true
    # Now that vcpkg is installed, it is being used to run desired arguments.
    - run: |
        $VCPKG_ROOT/vcpkg @$vcpkgResponseFile
        $VCPKG_ROOT/vcpkg install boost:linux-x64
```

## Best practices

### Use **vcpkg** as a submodule of your repository ###

When using **vcpkg**, be aware of how it works, specifically:
 - a specific version of vcpkg must be used either locally and on build servers;
 - a specific version of vcpkg is identified by the commit id of the used vcpkg repository;
 - it not possible to choose which version of a port to install, instead it is the used version of vcpkg that establishes which version (just one) of a port is available;
 
 To sum up, **you need to pin the specific version of vcpkg you want to use to keep a consistent development experience between local and remote build environments.** This is accomplished by **using vcpkg as submodule of your Git repository**; this way the version of vcpkg used is implied by the commit id specified by the submodule for vcpkg.

### Use vcpkg's response file as an argument

vcpkg accepts a response file that contains the arguments, suitable to store the list of ports to be installed. **It is useful to store the response file under source control, this helps to run vcpkg the same exact way locally and remotely on the build servers.** For example if you want to run:

 > vcpkg install boost zlib:x64 libmodbus --triplet x64

it is instead possible to run

 > vcpkg install @response_file.txt

 where `response_file.txt` contains (with no trailing whitespaces allowed):

```yaml
   boost
   zlib:x64
   libmodbus
   --triplet
   x64
```
