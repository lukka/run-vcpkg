# [The **run-vcpkg** action for using vcpkg on GitHub](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-vcpkg)

Build C++ software with the multi-platform **run-vcpkg** action by running [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) on GitHub workflows. [Samples](#samples) provided use [GitHub hosted runners](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners) and [Caching](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows).

A good companion is the [run-cmake](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-cmake) action.

### <a id='install'>Setup vcpkg and install ports</a>

It is __highly recommended__ to [use vcpkg as a submodule](https://github.com/lukka/CppBuildTasks/blob/master/README.md#use-vcpkg-as-a-submodule-of-your-git-repository). Here below the sample where vcpkg is a Git submodule:

```yaml
  # Sample when vcpkg is a submodule of your repository (highly recommended!)

    # Cache/Restore the vcpkg's build artifacts.
    - name: Cache vcpkg's artifacts
      uses: actions/cache@v1
      with:
        path: ${{ github.workspace }}/vcpkg/
        # The key will be different each time a different version of vcpkg is used, or different ports are installed.
        key: ${{ hashFiles( env.vcpkgResponseFile ) }}-${{ hashFiles('.git/modules/vcpkg/HEAD') }}-${{ runner.os }}

    # Download, build vcpkg, install requested ports. If content is restored by the previous step,
    # it is a no-op. 
    - name: Run vcpkg
      uses: lukka/run-vcpkg@v0
      with:
       # Response file stored in source control, it provides the list of ports and triplet(s).
        vcpkgArguments: '@${{ env.vcpkgResponseFile }}'
       # Location of the vcpkg as submodule of the repository.
        vcpkgDirectory: '${{ github.workspace }}/vcpkg'

    - name: 'Run CMake with Ninja'
      uses: lukka/run-cmake@v0
      with:
        cmakeListsOrSettingsJson: CMakeListsTxtAdvanced
        cmakeListsTxtPath: '${{ github.workspace }}/cmakesettings.json/CMakeLists.txt'
        useVcpkgToolchainFile: true
        buildDirectory: '${{ runner.workspace }}/b//unixmakefiles'
        cmakeAppendedArgs: '-G "Ninja" '
        # Or build multiple configurations out of a CMakeSettings.json file created with Visual Studio.
        # cmakeListsOrSettingsJson: CMakeSettingsJson
        # cmakeSettingsJsonPath: '${{ github.workspace }}/cmakesettings.json/CMakeSettings.json'
        # configurationRegexFilter: '${{ matrix.configuration }}'
```

## <a id='setuponly'>Setup vcpkg only</a>

The action can run as setup only step, that is just install and set VCPKG_ROOT enviroment variabla without isntalling any package. You can us the provisioned vcpkg as follows in subsequent steps:

```yaml
    - name: Cache vcpkg's artifacts
      uses: actions/cache@v1
      with:
        path: ${{ github.workspace }}/vcpkg/
        # The key will be different each time a different version of vcpkg is used, or different ports are installed.
        key: ${{ hashFiles( env.vcpkgResponseFile ) }}-${{ hashFiles('.git/modules/vcpkg/HEAD') }}-${{ runner.os }}
    # Download and build vcpkg, without installing any port. If content is cached already, it is a no-op.
    - name: Setup vcpkg
      uses: lukka/run-vcpkg@v0
      with:
        setupOnly: true
    # Now that vcpkg is installed, it is being used to run desired arguments.
    - run: |
        $VCPKG_ROOT/vcpkg @$vcpkgResponseFile
        $VCPKG_ROOT/vcpkg install boost:linux-x64
```

## <a id='run-vcpkg'>The ***run-vcpkg*** action</a>

This action behaves the same way as it does the [run-vcpkg](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lucappa.cmake-ninja-vcpkg-tasks) task for Azure DevOps.

The documentation of the **'run-vcpkg"** action is identical to the [**'run-vcpkg'** task's one](https://github.com/lukka/CppBuildTasks/blob/master/README.md#runvcpkg
) for Azure DevOps.

# Developers information

## Prerequisites
[gulp 4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp4) globally installed.

## Build and lint
Build with `tsc` running:

 > npm run build

Launch `lint` by:

 > npm run lint

## Packaging

  > npm run pack

## Testing

To build, pack and test:
 
 > npm run test

 To run test directly:
 
 > jest

[Smoke tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing_(software)) are implemented in this repository, which run the action on all platforms.

Rigorous tests are executed in the builds of [CppBuildTasks](https://github.com/lukka/CppBuildTasks/) repository that shares the same engine in the [run-cmake-vcpkg-action-libs](https://github.com/lukka/run-cmake-vcpkg-action-libs) submodule.

It would be desirable to have extensive tests implemented in this repository as well.

Validation tests on various scenarios are run using the workflows of the [Samples](#samples).
