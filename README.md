# Important: **run-vcpkg@v11 requirements**

`run-vcpkg@v11` requires vcpkg more recent than 2023-03-29 (e.g. commit id `5b1214315250939257ef5d62ecdcbca18cf4fb1c`).

# Quickstart with a C++ project template

Take a look at this [C++ project template](https://github.com/lukka/CppCMakeVcpkgTemplate/tree/v11) that applies all the following instructions, but also shows how to create a __pure__ workflow without using special GitHub action that you cannot run locally on your development machine, but directly using the tools (`CMake`, `Ninja`, `vcpkg`, `C++` compilers) you already use daily.

# [The **run-vcpkg@v11** action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-vcpkg)

The **run-vcpkg@v11** action setups (and optionally runs) [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to install the packages specified in the `vcpkg.json` manifest file.
It leverages the vcpkg's [Binary Caching](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/users/binarycaching) backed to [GitHub Action cache](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows), delegating cache and key management to vpckg.

Special features which provide added value over a __pure__ workflow are:
  - automatic caching leveraging `vcpkg`'s ability to store its [Binary Caching](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/users/binarycaching) artifacts onto the [GitHub Action cache](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows) so that packages are built only once and reused in subsequent workflow runs. The user can customize the behavior by setting the environment variable `VCPKG_BINARY_SOURCES` *before* vcpkg runs.
  - set the workflow variables `ACTIONS_CACHE_URL` and `ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN` to let users easily running vcpkg
  in a `run` step such as `- run: vcpkg install` or `- run: vcpkg integrate install` without forcing the
  users to set the variables manually.
  - automatic dump of log files created by `CMake` (e.g., `CMakeOutput.log`) and `vcpkg`. The content of those files flow into the workflow output log. Customizable by the user by setting the input `logCollectionRegExps`.
  - automatic parsing of `CMake`, `vcpkg` and `gcc`, `clang`, `msvc` errors, reporting them contextually in the workflow summary by means of annotations.
  - although disabled by default (see input `doNotCache`), `run-vcpkg` can cache vcpkg's executable and data files to speed up subsequent workflow runs. Since bootstrapping `vcpkg` already downloads a prebuilt binary saving the time to build `vcpkg`,
  this form of caching is useful only when the prebuilt executable is not served as it happens for the ARM platform.
  Note this cache does not contain the libraries built by vcpkg, which is instead managed by vcpkg itself.

The provided [samples](#samples) use [GitHub hosted runners](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners).

Good companions are the [run-cmake](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-cmake) and the
[get-cmake](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/get-cmake) actions.

## Quickstart with instructions

It is __highly recommended__ to use:
- [vcpkg as a submodule](#use-vcpkg-as-a-submodule-of-your-repository).
- a [vcpkg.json](#use-vcpkgs-vcpkgjson-file-to-specify-the-dependencies) manifest file to declaratively specify the dependencies.
- a `CMakePresets.json` file.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      #-uses: actions/cache@v3   <===== YOU DO NOT NEED THIS!

      # Install latest CMake and Ninja.
      - uses: lukka/get-cmake@latest
      # Or pin to a specific CMake version:
      # lukka/get-cmake@v3.27

      # Setup vcpkg: ensures vcpkg is downloaded and built.
      # Since vcpkg.json is being used later on to install the packages
      # when `run-cmake` runs, no packages are installed at this time
      # (and vcpkg does not run).
      - name: Setup anew (or from cache) vcpkg (and does not build any package)
        uses: lukka/run-vcpkg@v11 # Always specify the specific _version_ of the
                                  # action you need, `v10` in this case to stay up
                                  # to date with fixes on the v11 branch.
        #with:
          # This is the default location of the directory containing vcpkg sources.
          # Change it to the right location if needed.
          # vcpkgDirectory: '${{ github.workspace }}/vcpkg'

          # If not using a submodule for vcpkg sources, this specifies which commit
          # id must be checkout from a Git repo.
          # Note: it must not be set if using a Git submodule for vcpkg.
          # vcpkgGitCommitId: '${{ matrix.vcpkgCommitId }}'

          # This is only needed if the command `vcpkg install` must run at this step.
          # Instead it is highly suggested to let `run-cmake` to run vcpkg later on
          # using the vcpkg.cmake toolchain. The default is `false`.
          # runVcpkgInstall: true

          # This is only needed if `runVpkgInstall` is `true`.
          # This glob expression used to locate the vcpkg.json and  use
          # its directory location as `working directory` when running `vcpkg install`.
          # Change it to match a single manifest file you want to use.
          # Note: do not use `${{ github.context }}` to compose the value as it
          # contains backslashes that would be misinterpreted. Instead
          # compose a value relative to the root of the repository using
          # `**/path/from/root/of/repo/to/vcpkg.json` to match the desired `vcpkg.json`.
          # vcpkgJsonGlob: '**/vcpkg.json'

      - name: Run CMake consuming CMakePreset.json and run vcpkg to build packages
        uses: lukka/run-cmake@v10
        with:
          # This is the default path to the CMakeLists.txt along side the
          # CMakePresets.json. Change if you need have CMakeLists.txt and CMakePresets.json
          # located elsewhere.
          # cmakeListsTxtPath: '${{ github.workspace }}/CMakeLists.txt'

          # You could use CMake workflow presets defined in the CMakePresets.json
          # with just this line below. Note this one cannot be used with any other
          # preset input, it is mutually exclusive.
          # workflowPreset: 'workflow-name'

          # This is the name of the CMakePresets.json's configuration to use to generate
          # the project files. This configuration leverages the vcpkg.cmake toolchain file to
          # run vcpkg and install all dependencies specified in vcpkg.json.
          configurePreset: 'ninja-multi-vcpkg'
          # Additional arguments can be appended to the cmake command.
          # This is useful to reduce the number of CMake's Presets since you can reuse
          # an existing preset with different variables.
          configurePresetAdditionalArgs: "['-DENABLE_YOUR_FEATURE=1']"

          # This is the name of the CMakePresets.json's configuration to build the project.

          testPreset: 'ninja-multi-vcpkg'
          # Additional arguments can be appended when testing, for example to specify the config
          # to test.
          # This is useful to reduce the number of CMake's Presets you need in CMakePresets.json.
          testPresetAdditionalArgs: "['--config Release']"

    #env:
    #  [OPTIONAL] Define the vcpkg's triplet you want to enforce, otherwise the default one
    #  for the hosting system will be automatically choosen (x64 is the default on all
    #  platforms, e.g. `x64-osx`).
    #  VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET: ${{ matrix.triplet }}
    #
    #  [OPTIONAL] By default the action disables vcpkg's telemetry by defining VCPKG_DISABLE_METRICS.
    #  This behavior can be disabled by defining `VCPKG_ENABLE_METRICS` as follows.
    #  VCPKG_ENABLE_METRICS: 1

## Best practices

### Use **vcpkg** as a submodule of your repository

 **It is highly suggested to pin the specific version of vcpkg you want to use to keep a consistent development experience between local and remote build environments.** This is accomplished by **using vcpkg as submodule of your Git repository**; this way the version of `vcpkg` used is implied by the commit id specified by the submodule for `vcpkg`.

### Use vcpkg's vcpkg.json file to specify the dependencies

The [vcpkg.json](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/docs/specifications/manifests.md) is a manifest file that declaratively specifies the dependencies to be installed.
The file is being used automatically by running CMake (e.g. by using [run-cmake](https://github.com/lukka/run-cmake)) when:
 - starting CMake with the `vcpkg.cmake` toolchain file.
 - the root CMake source directory contains a [vcpkg.json](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/docs/specifications/manifests.md) file.

Or it can also be used by invoking `vcpkg install` in a directory where `vcpkg.json` is located (e.g., input `runVcpkgInstall : true`).

When conditions are satisfied, the toolchain execution starts [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to install the packages declared in the manifest file.

 **Putting this manifest-like file under source control is highly recommended as this helps to run vcpkg the same exact way locally and remotely on the build servers.**
The dependencies specified in the vcpkg.json file are installed when CMake runs (i.e. at `run-cmake` execution time).
