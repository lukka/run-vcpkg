# Before using this action, consider writing a [C++ CMake/vcpkg/Ninja based _pure_ workflow](https://github.com/lukka/CppBuildTasks-Validation/blob/master/.github/workflows/hosted-pure-workflow.yml)!

A __pure__ workflow is one without using special GitHub action that you cannot run locally on your development machine, but directly using the tools (`CMake`, `Ninja`, `vcpkg`) you already use daily. 
You can read more in this issue about it: https://github.com/lukka/run-vcpkg/issues/66

# [The **run-vcpkg@v10** action for caching artifacts and using vcpkg with manifest files on GitHub workflows](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-vcpkg)

The **run-vcpkg** action restores from cache [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) along with the previously installed packages, and then setup vcpkg to be run in a subsequent step. Or it runs it for you.

Special features which provide added value over a pure workflow are:
  - automatic cache management of vcpkg's artifacts by computing a cache key based (among others) on content of `vcpkg.json`.
  - automatic computation of the set of keys (primary key and secondary keys) used maximize the reuse of existing cached vcpkg's artifacts.
  - automatic dump of log files created by `CMake` (e.g., `CMakeOutput.log`) and `vcpkg`. The content of those files flow into the workflow output log. Customizable by the user.
  - automatic parsing of `CMake`, `vcpkg` and `gcc`, `clang`, `msvc` errors, reporting them contextually in the workflow summary by means of annotations.

The provided [samples](#samples) use [GitHub hosted runners](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners).

Good companions are the [run-cmake](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-cmake) action and the
[get-cmake](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/get-cmake) actions.

## Quickstart

It is __highly recommended__ to use:
- [vcpkg as a submodule](#vcpkgsubmodule).
- a [vcpkg.json](#vcpkgjson) manifest file to declaratively specify the dependencies.
- a CMakePreset.json file.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      #-uses: actions/cache@v1   <===== YOU DO NOT NEED THIS!

      # Install latest CMake.
      - uses: lukka/get-cmake@latest
      # Or pin to a specific CMake version:
      # lukka/get-cmake@v3.21.2

      # Restore from cache the previously built ports. If a "cache miss" occurs,
      # then vcpkg is bootstrapped. Since a the vcpkg.json is being used later on
      # to install the packages when `run-cmake` runs, no packages are installed at
      # this time.
      - name: Restore artifacts, or setup vcpkg (do not install any package)
        uses: lukka/run-vcpkg@v10
        #with:
          # This is the default location of the directory containing vcpkg sources.
          # Change it to the right location if needed.
          # vcpkgDirectory: '${{ github.workspace }}/vcpkg'

          # If not using a submodule for vcpkg sources, this specifies which commit
          # id must be checkout from a Git repo. It must not set if using a submodule
          # for vcpkg.
          # vcpkgGitCommitId: '${{ matrix.vcpkgCommitId }}'

          # This is the glob expression used to locate the vpkg.json and add its
          # hash to the cache key. Change it to match a single manifest file you want
          # to use.
          # vcpkgJsonGlob: '**/vcpkg.json'

          # This is needed to run `vcpkg install` command (after vcpkg is built) in
          # the directory where vcpkg.json has been located. Default is false,
          # It is highly suggested to let `run-cmake` to run vcpkg (i.e. `false`)
          # (i.e. let CMake run `vcpkg install`) using the vcpkg.cmake toolchain.
          # runVcpkgInstall: true

      - name: Run CMake consuming CMakePreset.json and vcpkg.json by mean of vcpkg.
        uses: lukka/run-cmake@v10
        with:
          # This is the default path to the CMakeLists.txt along side the
          # CMakePresets.json. Change if you need have CMakeLists.txt and CMakePresets.json
          # located elsewhere.
          # cmakeListsTxtPath: '${{ github.workspace }}/CMakeLists.txt'

          # This is the name of the CMakePresets.json's configuration to use to generate
          # the project files. This configuration leverages the vcpkg.cmake toolchain file to
          # run vcpkg and install all dependencies specified in vcpkg.json.
          configurePreset: 'ninja-multi-vcpkg'

          # This is the name of the CMakePresets.json's configuration to build the project.
          buildPreset: 'ninja-multi-vcpkg'
```

## Best practices

### Use **vcpkg** as a submodule of your repository

 **It is highly suggested to pin the specific version of vcpkg you want to use to keep a consistent development experience between local and remote build environments.** This is accomplished by **using vcpkg as submodule of your Git repository**; this way the version of `vcpkg` used is implied by the commit id specified by the submodule for `vcpkg`.

### Use vcpkg's vcpkg.json file to specify the dependencies

The [vcpkg.json](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/docs/specifications/manifests.md) is a manifest file that declaratively specifies the dependencies to be installed.
The file is being used automatically by running CMake (e.g. by using [run-cmake](https://github.com/lukka/run-cmake)) when:
 - starting CMake with the `vcpkg.cmake` toolchain file.
 - the root CMake source directory contains a [vcpkg.json](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/docs/specifications/manifests.md) file.

Or it can also be used by invoking `vcpkg install` in a directory where `vcpkg.json` is located (e.g., input `runVcpkgInstall : true`).

When conditions are satisfied, the toolchain execution starts [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to install the packages declared in the manifest file.

 *Putting this manifest-like file under source control is highly recommended as this helps to run vcpkg the same exact way locally and remotely on the build servers.**
The dependencies specified in the vcpkg.json file are installed when CMake runs (i.e. at `run-cmake` execution time).
