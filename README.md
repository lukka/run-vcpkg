# [The **run-vcpkg** action for caching artifacts and using vcpkg on GitHub](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-vcpkg)

The **run-vcpkg** action restores from cache [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) along with the previously installed ports. Briefly:
 - If there is a cache miss, vpckg is fetched and installed; the cache's key is composed by hashing the hosting OS, the command line arguments and the vcpkg's commit id.
 - Then vcpkg is run to install the desired ports. This is a no-op if artifacts are already installed; This step can be skipped with `setupOnly:true`;
 - Artifacts are finally cached (if needed) as a post action at the end of the `job`.

The provided [samples](#samples) use [GitHub hosted runners](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners).

Good companions are the [run-cmake](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-cmake) action and the 
[get-cmake](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/get-cmake) action.

## <a id='quickstart'>Quickstart</a>

### <a id='install'>Setup vcpkg and install ports</a>

It is __highly recommended__ to [use vcpkg as a submodule](https://github.com/lukka/CppBuildTasks/blob/master/README.md#use-vcpkg-as-a-submodule-of-your-git-repository). Here below the sample where vcpkg is a Git submodule:

```yaml
  # Sample when vcpkg is a submodule of your repository (highly recommended!)

    #-uses: actions/cache@v1   <===== YOU DO NOT NEED THIS!

    # Install latest CMake.
    - uses: lukka/get-cmake@v2

    # Restore from cache the previously built ports. If "cache miss", then provision vcpkg, install desired ports, finally cache everything for the next run.
    - name: Restore from cache and run vcpkg
      uses: lukka/run-vcpkg@v2
      with:
        # Response file stored in source control, it provides the list of ports and triplet(s).
        vcpkgArguments: '@${{ env.vcpkgResponseFile }}'
        # Location of the vcpkg as submodule of the repository.
        vcpkgDirectory: '${{ github.workspace }}/vcpkg'
        # Since the cache must be invalidated when content of the response file changes, let's
        # compute its hash and append this to the computed cache's key.
        appendedCacheKey: ${{ hashFiles(env.vcpkgResponseFile) }}

    - name: 'Build with CMake and Ninja'
      uses: lukka/run-cmake@v2
      with:
        cmakeListsOrSettingsJson: CMakeListsTxtAdvanced
        cmakeListsTxtPath: '${{ github.workspace }}/cmakesettings.json/CMakeLists.txt'
        useVcpkgToolchainFile: true
        buildDirectory: '${{ runner.workspace }}/b/ninja'
        cmakeAppendedArgs: '-GNinja Multi-Config'
        # Or build multiple configurations out of a CMakeSettings.json file created with Visual Studio.
        # cmakeListsOrSettingsJson: CMakeSettingsJson
        # cmakeSettingsJsonPath: '${{ github.workspace }}/cmakesettings.json/CMakeSettings.json'
        # configurationRegexFilter: '${{ matrix.configuration }}'
```

### <a id='setuponly'>Setup vcpkg only</a>

When `setupOnly: true`, it only setups vcpkg and set VCPKG_ROOT enviroment variable without installing any port. The provisioned vcpkg can then be used as follows in a subsequent step:

```yaml
    # Restore from cache the previously built ports. If cache-miss, download, build vcpkg.
    - name: Restore from cache and install vcpkg
      # Download and build vcpkg, without installing any port. If content is cached already, it is a no-op.
      uses: lukka/run-vcpkg@v2
      with:
        setupOnly: true
    # Now that vcpkg is installed, it is being used to run desired arguments.
    - run: |
        $VCPKG_ROOT/vcpkg @$vcpkgResponseFile
        $VCPKG_ROOT/vcpkg install boost:linux-x64
```

[Smoke tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing_(software)) are implemented in this repository, which run the action on all platforms.

Rigorous tests are executed in the builds of [CppBuildTasks](https://github.com/lukka/CppBuildTasks/) repository that shares the same engine in the [run-cmake-vcpkg-action-libs](https://github.com/lukka/run-cmake-vcpkg-action-libs) submodule.

It would be desirable to have extensive tests implemented in this repository as well.

Validation tests on various scenarios are run using the workflows of the [Samples](#samples).
